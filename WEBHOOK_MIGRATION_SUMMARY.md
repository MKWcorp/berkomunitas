# Clerk Webhook Handler - Multi-Email Support

## 🔄 **Migration Summary**

The Clerk webhook handler has been refactored to support a new multi-email database structure where emails are stored in a separate `member_emails` table instead of directly in the `members` table.

## 📋 **Database Schema Changes**

### Before:
```sql
members {
  id, clerk_id, email, nama_lengkap, ...
}
```

### After:
```sql
members {
  id, clerk_id, nama_lengkap, ...
}

member_emails {
  id, clerk_id, email, is_primary, verified
}
```

## 🚀 **New Webhook Handler Features**

### 1. **`user.created` Event**
- ✅ Creates a new record in `members` table with `clerk_id`
- ✅ Loops through all `email_addresses` from Clerk webhook data
- ✅ Creates corresponding records in `member_emails` table
- ✅ Sets `is_primary` and `verified` flags based on Clerk data
- ✅ Auto-assigns default 'user' privilege

### 2. **`user.updated` Event**
- ✅ Updates member information (name, etc.)
- ✅ Intelligently synchronizes `member_emails` table:
  - Adds new email addresses
  - Updates status of existing emails (`is_primary`, `verified`)
  - Removes deleted emails
- ✅ Handles multiple email management

### 3. **`user.deleted` Event**
- ✅ Deletes member record by `clerk_id`
- ✅ Cascade deletion automatically handles `member_emails` cleanup

## 🛡️ **Security & Error Handling**

- ✅ Maintains all existing webhook verification
- ✅ Uses database transactions where appropriate
- ✅ Handles edge cases (missing emails, verification status)
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

- ✅ **Database Transactions**: Uses `prisma.$transaction()` for atomic operations
- ✅ **Bulk Operations**: Uses `createMany` with `skipDuplicates` for efficiency
- ✅ **Intelligent Email Sync**: Smart diff algorithm for email updates
- ✅ **Primary Email Logic**: Automatically determines primary email (verified > first)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Specific error codes (P2002, P2025) with appropriate responses
- ✅ **Connection Management**: Proper Prisma connection cleanup with `$disconnect()`
- ✅ **Referential Integrity**: Maintains CASCADE constraints for data consistency
- ✅ **Production Logging**: Enhanced logging with emojis for better monitoring

## ✅ **Ready for Deployment**

The webhook handler is now production-ready and supports:
- ✅ Multiple emails per user with proper primary designation
- ✅ Real-time email verification status tracking
- ✅ Atomic database operations with rollback on failure
- ✅ Intelligent synchronization with Clerk changes
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Backwards compatibility with existing privilege system
- ✅ Performance optimized with bulk operations
- ✅ Production-grade connection management

## 🧪 **Testing**

Use the test file at `scripts/test-webhook.js` to validate webhook functionality with mock Clerk payloads.
